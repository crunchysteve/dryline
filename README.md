Rear disk brake cable drain for touring and urban work bicycles fitted with mechanical disk brakes.

Cable pulled disk brakes, common on drop bar road, CX, touring and urban bicycles fill the rear cable up with gunge because of the "upside down" mount, inside the rear triangle. This SCAD file is a design for an inline cable drain which can be 3D printed and fitted inside the left-hand chainstay to stop water pooling in the cable below the bottom bracket.

Initially, Dryline was an attempt at a "manufacture on demand" product to supplement my income, but it seems that, while many in the cycle touring community think it's a good idea, few want to purchase and install one, so I've open sourced it here. A CNC could also be programmed to make this in aluminium, as well is it being easy to create an STL from the SCAD file, then g-code for your printer/CNC from the STL file.

Dryline is released to the public under a Creative Commons 4.0 licence, with attribution, non-commercial and share-alike conditions. Feel free to alter the code for the better, fork or otherwise use, provided my CC4 conditions are met.

I am still willing to make on demand for those who don't have a 3D printer or adequate CNC to make their own. Contact me via the Thingiverse page for Dryline. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3373400
